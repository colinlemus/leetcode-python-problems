# Problem 5 - Top K Frequent Elements
# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]

# Constraints:
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
# It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

# Solution Benchmark Analysis:
# Runtime: 1.87 Î¼s
# Memory Usage: 72 bytes
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(n)

# Explanation:
# This algorithm finds the k most frequent elements in an input list of integers utilizing bucket sort.
# The algorithm first creates a dictionary to store the frequencies of the elements in the input list.
# The algorithm then creates a list of lists to store the elements grouped by their frequency.
# The algorithm then collects the elements from the list of lists to form the answer, starting from the elements with the highest frequency.
# The algorithm returns the k most frequent elements. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list.

    # Collect the elements from the list of lists to form the answer
