# Problem 7 - Valid Sudoku
# Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
# Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
# A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
# Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

# Example 1:
# Input: board =
# [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: board =
# [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
# ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
# ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
# ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
# ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
# ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
# ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
# ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
# ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
# Output: false

# Constraints:
#     board.length == 9
#     board[i].length == 9
#     board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.

# Explanation:
# This algorithm checks if a given 9x9 Sudoku board is valid.
# The algorithm first creates three sets to store the values in each row, column, and box of the board.
# The algorithm then iterates over the board and checks if each value is already in the corresponding set for its row, column, and box.
# If a value is already in one of the sets, the board is not valid.
# If a value is not in any of the sets, the algorithm adds the value to the corresponding sets.
# If the algorithm goes through the entire board without returning False, the board is valid.
# This algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), because the size of the board is fixed.
